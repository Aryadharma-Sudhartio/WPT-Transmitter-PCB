# WPT-Transmitter-PCB
This PCB is made as transmitter side of WPT system before the power forwarded to transmitter coil, in this PCB there is inverter, double-sided compensation, MOSFET driver circuit, microcontroller signal, and auxiliary power.

Component placement in this PCB are categorized to make troubleshooting easier, it consist of main power component, mosfet driver, inverter, and compensation circuit.

Tracks used for power line are made wider to decrease resistance and dissipate heat more evenly, for signal tracks it is made as short as possible to reduce noise possibility.

Vias stitching are also used to further increase total area of copper to minimize resistance in higher power tracks.

For high voltage such as compensation components, air gap are used to prevent voltage arc, it is also set further from other component to prevent noise from high switching frequencies.
